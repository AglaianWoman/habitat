Each plan can specify lifecycle event handlers, or hooks, to perform certain actions during a service's runtime. Each hook is a shell script. Bash plans use a [shebang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)) defined at the top to specify the interpreter to be used. Powershell plans will always execute the hook script using the [Powershell Core](https://github.com/PowerShell/Powershell) shell environment.
