The Habitat Studio is a self-contained, minimal, clean shell environment in which you can develop, build, and package software.

Linux based studios are [chrooted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroot) and free from any software libraries or dependencies that are not specified by you in your application's plan.

Windows based studios run inside a Powershell Core environment and have a path that only includes the Windows system directories and core Habitat services.
